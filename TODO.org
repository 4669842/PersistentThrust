* DONE Save current throttle and Isp to other variables
* DONE During timewarp, perturb orbit and mass based on saved throttle and Isp [3/3]
** DONE Perturb orbit
** DONE Perturb mass
** DONE Perturb other resources (e.g. energy)
* DONE Look up energy consumption
* DONE Look up mass consumption
* DONE Format thrust in more readable form [3/3]
** DONE mN when < 1 N
** DONE N when < 1000 N
** DONE kN when < 1000000 N
* DONE Drop out of timewarp on depletion of any resource
* TODO Scale energy to more realistic amount
* DONE Show resource consumption
