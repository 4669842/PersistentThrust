** DONE Perturb mass
** DONE Perturb other resources (e.g. energy)
* DONE Look up energy consumption
* DONE Look up mass consumption
* DONE Format thrust in more readable form [3/3]
** DONE mN when < 1 N

* TODO Bug: At time warps >= 100X, energy use doesn't balance with sample craft
** Sample craft: 1 ion engine, 2 gigantor XL solar arrays, Z-200 battery
** 5% throttle
** At 100x and 1000x, batteries a little low
** At 1000x, batteries ~50%
** At max warp, batteries deplete, but vessel doesn't shutdown
* TODO Use one or more deltaV propellants [0/2] 			:BUG:
** TODO Iterate over list of deltaV propellants and calculate demand and deltaV
** TODO Automatically detect which propellants contribute to deltaV
*** Do they have density units?
* TODO With solar electric ion engine spacecraft, batteries deplete in high timewarp, even though the panels generate enough ElectricCharge [1/2] :BUG:
** DONE Temporarily bypass by turning off resource request and depletion
** TODO Fix
* TODO In timewarp, persistent engines lower a suborbital engine when they should be raising it [0/2] :BUG:
** TODO Temporary fix: throw error message when suborbital & in timewarp, don't perturb orbit
** TODO Make it work
* TODO Make TweakScale work with parts [0/2]			    :FEATURE:
** TODO Solar sail
** TODO Ion engine
* TODO Realistic sail attitude control				   :WISHLIST:
** Vanes to cause solar torque about CM
** Gimbaled boom to shift CM
** Realistic moments of inertia (i.e. BIG)
** IKAROS style thin film reflective control devices
* TODO Make new solar sail models [0/5]
** TODO Square sail (LightSail, Lunar Flashlight, NEA Scout)
*** 4 triangular panels with billowed shape
*** Wrinkled looking surface
** TODO Sunjammer
*** 4 triangular panels with stripe net and billow in between
** TODO Steering vanes
*** Vanes at boom tips that rotate to face sun with ~20 deg cant for stability
** TODO Halley Rendezvous square sail
*** Big, billowed sail with masts and stays
** TODO IKAROS
*** Animated rotation
**** Scale rotation speed to sensible amount during time warp
*** Animate change in reflective control device color as it performs attitude maneuvers
